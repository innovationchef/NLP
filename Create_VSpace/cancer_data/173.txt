Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP) is a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair. This chapter outlines the discovery of the PARP family and the rationale for the development of PARP inhibitors as a novel class of anticancer agents, with a brief evaluation of the preclinical evidence for chemo-potentiation, radio-potentiation, and also single agent activity in homologous recombination defective cancers. Emerging data on PARP trapping as an alternative mechanism of action is discussed. The clinical development of the PARP inhibitors as a class is described with the emerging data on the value of the identification of molecular biomarkers for response which are widening the therapeutic indications. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
