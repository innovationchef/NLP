Kokum, a spice derived from the fruit of the Garcinia hanburyi tree, is traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicines to facilitate digestion and to treat sores, dermatitis, diarrhoea, dysentery, and ear infection. One of the major active components of kokum is gambogic acid, also known as guttic acid, guttatic acid, beta-guttilactone, and beta-guttiferin. Gambogic acidÔÇÖs anti-proliferative, anti-bacterial; antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects result from its modulation of numerous cell-signaling intermediates. This chapter discusses the sources, chemical components, mechanism of action, and disease targets of the kokum spice. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
