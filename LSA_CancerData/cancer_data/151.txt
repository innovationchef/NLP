A growing body of evidence suggests that the risk of development and progression of a variety of human chronic diseases depends on epigenetic modifications triggered by environmental cues during early life sensitive stages and, to a lesser extent, throughout adulthood. Environmental factors such as exposure to adverse nutritional, psychological, and social conditions, as well as to environmental pollutants, substances of abuse, and infections have been shown to be important determinants of epigenetic programing of chronic pathological conditions in modern human populations. Over the past years, it has become increasingly clear owing to the epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), that early environmental insults can induce long-lasting widespread epigenetic dysregulation. Several candidate genes have been identified underlying these associations. In this context, DNA methylation is the most intensively studied epigenetic phenomenon. In the present chapter, recent epidemiological studies are reviewed, suggesting the role of epigenetic factors in mediating the relationship between life-course environmental exposures and long-term health outcomes. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
