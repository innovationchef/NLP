Different types of exercise and physical activities induce mechanical, hormonal, and metabolic stimuli, leading to adaptions of almost every tissue and cell-type. Recent research has shown that both acute and chronic exercise are potential epigenetic modifiers (affecting DNA methylation, posttranslational histone modifications, and the expression of micro RNAs), changing the functional genome in gametes, muscle-, blood-, and fat-cells in brain tissue as well as in cells of the cardiovascular system. The results of these studies reveal that exercise-induced epigenetic modifications may counteract pathophysiological alterations of the epigenome, for example, in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. It is hypothesized that positive preventative and rehabilitative effects of exercise are at least partly driven by epigenetic modifications, which for instance contribute to a reduced systemic inflammation and local adaptions, such as a demethylation of tumor-suppressor genes. Furthermore, first data shows that responders to specific exercise programs (eg, resistance training) express another epigenetic pattern compared to nonresponders. Additionally, different types and intensities of exercise exhibit specific epigenetic responses, which can be directly measured in muscle tissue but also in the circulation. Therefore, epigenetic adaptions may be used as markers for exercise conducting and controlling in the future. However, more research is needed to receive more profound and meaningful knowledge about exercise-induced epigenetic modifications in particular tissues and their consequences. Since exercise seems to provoke different responses throughout the life-span and the speculation that exercise can rewind the epigenetic "clock," age should always be considered as a covariate in further studies. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
