Mass spectrometry-based approaches are utilized with increasing frequency to facilitate identification of novel SUMO target proteins and to elucidate the dynamics of SUMOylation in response to cellular stresses. Here, we describe a robust method for the identification of SUMO target proteins, and the relative quantification of SUMOylation dynamics, using a label-free approach. The method relies on a decahistidine (His 10 )-tagged SUMO, which is expressed at a low level in a mammalian cell line or model organism. The His 10 -tag allows for a single-step, high-yield, and high-purity enrichment of SUMOylated proteins, which are then digested and analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Matching between runs and labelfree quantification integrated in the freely available MaxQuant software allow for a high rate and accuracy of quantification, providing a strong alternative to laborious sample or cell labeling techniques. The method described here allows for identification of >1000 SUMO target proteins, and characterization of their SUMOylation dynamics, without requiring sample fractionation. The purification procedure, starting from total lysate, can be performed in ~4 days. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.
