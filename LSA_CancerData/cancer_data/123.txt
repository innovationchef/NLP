The development of hormone-dependent cancers has an important epigenetic component. Breast and prostate cancers are two of the most prevalent hormone-dependent cancers and display important epigenetic alterations of DNA methylation and histone modifications. These alterations impact on their development, their progression, and their therapeutical response to endocrine therapy. Factors influencing the epigenetics of hormone-dependent cancers include genetic alterations, the metabolic status of the cancer cells, as well as environmental factors such as the diet, exposition to endocrine disruptors, and health states underlying endocrine dysfunctions inclusive of obesity and diabetes. By impacting on the metabolic state of the cancer cells, these environmental factors alter the epigenetic profiles inherent to hormone-dependent cancers. The impact of these factors and their interplay in modulating the epigenome of breast and prostate cancer is discussed in this chapter. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
