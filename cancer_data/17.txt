Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and the 5-year overall survival outlook for a patient has not improved in several decades. Recently, however, molecular and genomic profi ling of the lung tumors has revealed recurring somatic mutations. As a result the therapeutic landscape of lung cancer is undergoing a paradigm shift from a purely histology-based understanding of the disease to subtype distinctions based on tumor genetics, which has launched cancer-specifi c, mechanism-based targeted therapies with clear benefi t to patients. While targeted therapy advancements are being made at an ever increasing rate, a new challenge in the form of drug resistance has also emerged. This review summarizes the current literature for these issues. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
