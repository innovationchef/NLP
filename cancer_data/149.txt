In concert with genetic mechanisms, epigenetic modifications finely regulate gene expression in physiological conditions, during cellular development, and in response to external stimuli. In disease conditions, the epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are often deregulated. Cardiac muscle remodeling, skeletal muscle metabolism, and smooth muscle cell plasticity are largely influenced by epigenetic changes. How epigenetics regulates these processes in muscle tissues will be reviewed in this chapter with a focus on the mechanisms of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and regulation by noncoding RNAs. Strong associations between changes in epigenetics and disease progression have been described in many muscular disorders, thus rendering drugs that affect epigenetics, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and microRNA-targeting drugs, efficient tools for the treatment of patients. Among the muscular diseases, this chapter will discuss motor neuron degeneration diseases, rhabdomyosarcoma, and muscular dystrophies. How epigenetics influences these pathologies and the potential usefulness of epigenetic drugs for the treatment of these diseases will also be discussed in this chapter. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
