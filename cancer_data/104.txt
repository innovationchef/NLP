The Golgi complex of mammalian cells is composed of stacks of flattened cisternae that are connected by tubules to form a continuous membrane system, also known as the Golgi ribbon. At the onset of mitosis, the Golgi ribbon is progressively fragmented into small tubular-vesicular clusters and it is reconstituted before completion of cytokinesis. The investigation of the mechanisms behind this reversible cycle of disassembly and reassembly has led to the identification of structural Golgi proteins and regulators. Moreover, these studies allowed to discover that disassembly of the ribbon is necessary for cell entry into mitosis. Here, we describe an in vitro assay that reproduces the mitotic Golgi fragmentation and that has been successfully employed to identify many important mechanisms and proteins involved in the mitotic Golgi reorganization. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.
