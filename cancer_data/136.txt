Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have emerged as potential cancer therapeutic agents, and several classes of them have exhibited good anticancer activity with a favorable toxicity profile in hematologic malignancies. In addition, HDAC inhibitors have shown promise in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Furthermore, they are emerging as promising antifibrotic, antiinflammatory, and antidiabetic agents.Because aberrant activity and expression of HDACs are implicated in the development of a wide range of human diseases, various HDAC inhibitors are being investigated for their therapeutic potential. Furthermore, due to the demonstrable activity and favorable toxicity profile, some of the HDAC inhibitors have received approval from the US FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma as well as cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other drugs.Although preclinical trials show that HDAC inhibitors have a variety of biological effects across multiple pathways, the mechanism by which the clinical activity is mediated remains unclear. Understanding mechanisms of action of HDAC inhibitors is necessary not only for finding of predictive biomarkers in disease initiation and progression, but for the design of optimized clinical protocols.This chapter describes the effects of HDAC inhibitors on cancer, schizophrenia, diabetes, and fibrotic and inflammatory diseases based on the findings from both preclinical studies and clinical trials. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
