The formation of periductal lymphocytic infiltrates within the inflamed salivary glands represents the histological hallmark of primary Sj├Âgren's syndrome (pSS). Lymphomonocytic aggregates can spread within the tissue, affecting salivary gland morphology and function. On a discrete percentage of patients (?25%), it is possible to observe formation of organized germinal center (GC)-like structure, detection of which has been correlated to lymphoma development. Salivary gland histopathology is considered the gold standard for pSS diagnosis and is highly recommended in early phase clinical trials as a disease biomarker. This chapter reviews the histological features of normal and diseased salivary glands in the context of pSS and provides the reader with a tool to understand pSS histopathology and differential diagnosis, and to identify in the tissue key elements that characterize pSS pathogenesis. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
