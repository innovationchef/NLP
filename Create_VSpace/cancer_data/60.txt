Interleukin-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced primarily by pathogen-activated antigen-presenting cells, particularly macrophages and dendritic cells, during encountering with intracellular microbes. IL-12 plays a key role in the activation of natural killer cells and CD4+ T helper cells in both innate and adaptive immune responses against infectious agents and immunosurveillance against endogenous malignancies. However, the potency of IL-12 makes it a target for stringent regulation. Indeed, the temporal, spatial, and quantitative expression of IL-12 during an immune response in a microenvironment contributes critically to the determination of the type, extent, and ultimate resolution of the reaction. Breaching of the delicate control and balance involving IL-12 frequently leads to autoimmune inflammatory disorders and pathogenesis. Thus, a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in the production and control of this cytokine is both scientifically significant and clinically beneficial. Here we provide an update on the research that has been conducted on this subject particularly in the last 10 years since the publication of a major thesis of this nature. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.
