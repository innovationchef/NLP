Much advancement has been made in the understanding of phenotype through regulation of the genome by epigenetic mechanisms. Advancing technologies have enabled epigenetic analysis in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. These findings have significant clinical potential. Epigenetic changes occur very early in the transition to disease state and therefore can be used as biomarkers for earlier diagnoses, risk stratification, and chemoprevention. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications have several therapeutic implications; they can be used to assess the effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention and they can be directly targeted with epigenomic modifying agents. Further research is needed to better understand how epigenomic modifications are regulated and how they interact with the environment, to characterize epigenetic profiles through disease progression, and to investigate epigenetic therapeutics. The ability to modify gene regulation through epigenetic therapy may be able to rectify aberrant epigenetic profiles in diseased cells. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
