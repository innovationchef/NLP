Multidrug resistance has appeared to mitigate the efficiency of anticancer drugs and the possibility of successful cancer chemotherapy. The Hedgehog receptor Patched is a multidrug transporter expressed in several cancers and as such it represents a new target to circumvent chemotherapy resistance. In this chapter, we describe the screening test developed to identify molecules able to inhibit the drug efflux activity of Patched. This screening test uses yeast over expressing functional human Patched that have been shown to resist to chemotherapeutic agents. This test can be adapted to other MDR transporters. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.
