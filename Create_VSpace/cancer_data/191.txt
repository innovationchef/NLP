The recent discovery of a variety of T-cell subpopulations challenged the long-standing paradigm of the T helper (Th) 1/Th2 immune response. The possible involvement of such novel cell subsets in autoimmunity fueled the investigation in this field. It is now becoming evident that Th17 cells as well as T regulatory and follicular T helper cells are leading actors in the scenario of primary Sj├Âgren's syndrome (SS) pathogenesis. Although sometimes conflicting, a consistent amount of data is available to date supporting that expanded T 17 cells are crucial in the induction and maintenance of chronic glandular inflammation and, eventually, ectopic lymphoid neogenesis. On the other hand, an impairment of counter-regulatory T lymphocytes may account for an imbalance between the effector and the suppressive arm of the autoimmune response. The better understanding of the abnormal T-cell response occurring in SS may provide the basis to target specific T-lymphocyte subpopulations for therapeutic purposes in this disease. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
