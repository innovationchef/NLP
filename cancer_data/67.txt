This chapter focuses on topical administration to the skin. Topical drugs may exert their effect either locally or systemically or both. Upon administration they are designed to penetrate into the skin and may also permeate through the skin to reach the systemic circulation. Safety testing of topically applied drugs therefore comprises of two components, the local skin exposure and the systemic exposure of parent drug and metabolites. The chapter includes a literature review of the current knowledge of metabolic enzymes in human skin and various skin models and also touches upon metabolic differences in diseased human skin and between human and animal species. Knowledge of local metabolism in the skin may be used actively by the medicinal chemist to design substances which are efficacious locally and likely less toxic when entering into the systemic circulation. The chapter specifically discusses safety testing of topical drugs. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.
