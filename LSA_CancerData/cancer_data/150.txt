This chapter will cover key concepts related to multiple common environmental exposures such as allergens, pollutants, chemicals, and dietary exposures, and the latest findings implicating them as underlying mechanisms for disease development or exacerbation via epigenetic processes. Recent animal models and human cohort studies addressing these exposures will be stressed, as will the importance of specific time windows of exposure. Epigenome-wide and gene-specific associations will be covered. Results suggest that despite the great expansion of this field in recent years, many fundamental questions and research gaps remain, particularly those related to understanding the mechanisms that cause chronic diseases and the importance of specific time periods of environmental exposure. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
