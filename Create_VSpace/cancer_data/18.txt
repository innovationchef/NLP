In the field of pathology it is clear that molecular genomics and digital imaging represent two promising future directions, and both are as relevant to the tumor microenvironment as they are to the tumor itself (Beck AH et al. Sci Transl Med 3(108):108ra113-08ra113, 2011). Digital imaging, or whole slide imaging (WSI), of glass histology slides facilitates a number of value-added competencies which were not previously possible with the traditional analog review of these slides under a microscope by a pathologist. As an important tool for investigational research, digital pathology can leverage the quantification and reproducibility offered by image analysis to add value to the pathology field. This chapter will focus on the application of image analysis to investigate the tumor microenvironment and how quantitative investigation can provide deeper insight into our understanding of the tumor to tumor microenvironment relationship. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
