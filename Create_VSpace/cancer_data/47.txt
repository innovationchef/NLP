Renewal of rod photoreceptor outer segments in the mammalian eye involves synchronized diurnal shedding after light onset of spent distal outer segment fragments (POS) linked to swift clearance of shed POS from the subretinal space by the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Engulfed POS phagosomes in RPE cells mature to acidified phagolysosomes, which accomplish enzymatic degradation of POS macromolecules. Here, we used an acidophilic fluorophore LysoTracker to label acidic organelles in freshly dissected, live rat RPE tissue flat mounts. We observed that all RPE cells imaged contained numerous acidified POS phagolysosomes whose abundance per cell was dramatically increased 2 h after light onset as compared to either 1 h before or 4 h after light onset. Lack of organelles of similar diameter (of 1ÔÇô2 ╬╝m) in phagocytosis-defective mutant RCS rat RPE confirmed that LysoTracker live imaging detected POS phagolysosomes. Lack of increase in lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 in RPE/choroid during the diurnal phagocytic burst suggests that formation of POS phagolysosomes in RPE in situ may not involve extra lysosome membrane biogenesis. Taken together, we report a new imaging approach that directly detects POS phagosome acidification and allows rapid tracking and quantification of POS phagocytosis by live RPE tissue ex situ. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
