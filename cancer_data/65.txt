The regulatory guidance for the safety testing of drug metabolites issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) outlines specific requirements for the profiling of circulating drug metabolites during early clinical drug development. Metabolite physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have also proved useful in investigating the efficacy of the tamoxifen metabolite endoxifen and the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil metabolites during cancer therapy. This chapter provides the algorithms of metabolite PBPK modeling and simulation in the Simcyp Simulator. It focuses on the full PBPK model for both parent compound and its metabolites. The chapter mainly focuses on the formation/absorption, distribution, elimination, and DDIs of metabolites. Modeling of metabolite PK can become even more complex if the metabolite, for example, is transformed back to the parent compound. Such back-conversion is common for the metabolites of corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone and methylprednisone) and sulfonamides, as well as for acyl glucuronide metabolites. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
