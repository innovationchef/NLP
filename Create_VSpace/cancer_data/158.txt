Inflammasomes are macromolecular cytoplasmic complexes that act as signaling platforms for the activation of inflammatory caspases. Their activation triggers the processing and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1╬▓ and IL-18, as well as the induction of a specialized form of inflammatory cell death termed pyroptosis. Here, we review the mechanisms of inflammasome activation triggered by the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We highlight the different inflammasome subfamilies utilized by macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and intestinal epithelial cells response to a Salmonella infection as well as the Salmonella ligands that trigger each inflammasomeÔÇÖs formation. We also discuss the evasion strategies utilized by Salmonella to avoid inflammasome detection. Overall, inflammasomes play a key and multilayered role at distinct stages of host cell defense against Salmonella infection. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
