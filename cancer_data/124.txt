Disease manifestation results from the interaction of the genome with environment stimuli in a complex interplay that ultimately affects both the structure and function of the genome. Both genetic and epigenetic changes affect the genome and are equally important players in this process and ultimately affect the disease outcomes. The past decades have seen an exponential increase in our understanding of both genetic and epigenetic events in the normal and disease states with the advent of whole genome technologies. As the cost of these whole genome technologies has diminished, there is now emerging use of biomarkers including single gene as well as multigene sets or whole arrays to accurately predict the course or the outcome of a particular disease. This review summarizes the current knowledge on both genetic and epigenetic changes in genes associated with various diseases with a special focus on cancer. Epigenetic changes should be considered in conjunction with genetic changes to be exploited in the clinics as biomarkers for prognosis. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
