It was hoped that the Human Genome Project would launch a new era for medicine, providing new insights into the mechanism, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous diseases. However, even as it was being completed, scientists were realizing that there was a layer of epigenetic code not explained by Mendelian inheritance, but which helped control our subtly balanced life support system. To date, knowledge about epigenetics in biological processes is rapidly increasing due to the discovery of new epigenetic code and the development of new techniques for epigenome profiling. For example, new epigenetic alterations related to normal development and disease pathogenesis are continuously discovered. These variants are involved in DNA methylation, histone modification, histone variation, and control of noncoding RNAs. Owing to these discoveries, the US Food and Drug Administration have approved at least seven epigenetic drugs and more agents are on the way. Furthermore, mounting reference epigenomes from healthy and diseased human cells are being mapped under the concerted effort of the International Human Epigenome Consortium, which promises to be a great resource for disease diagnostics, prognostics, and clinical therapeutics. Eventually, with the personalized epigenetic information, the precision medicine will help deliver the right treatment to the individual patient at the right time, which is the ultimate goal of future medical epigenetics. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
