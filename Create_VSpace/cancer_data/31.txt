Morpholino oligonucleotides(MO) are an innovative tool that provides a means for examining andmodifying gene expression outcomes by antisense interaction with targeted RNA transcripts. The site-specific nature of their binding facilitates focused modulation to alter splice variant expression patterns. Here we describe the steric-blocking of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) ╬ö╬▒ and ╬ö╬▓ splice variants using MO to examine cellular outcomes related to pluripotency and differentiation in human embryonic stem cells. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.
