Hyperactivity of B cells is one of the main features of primary Sj├Âgren's syndrome (pSS). They have indeed been shown to produce autoantibodies, to synthesize cytokines, and to act as antigen-presenting cells. An increased ratio of mature B (Bm) 2 (CD38+IgD+) to Bm2' (CD38++IgD+) cells, along with a decreased number of early Bm5 (CD38+IgD- or CD38-IgD-) cells characterizes the disease. This reduction in the number of circulating memory B cells is associated with the settlement of memory B cells, transitional type 2, memory and marginal zone-like B cells in the salivary glands, suggesting that B cells play a leading part in the in situ autoantibody production. In addition, these patients show elevated serum levels of the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) of the tumor necrosis factor family, which rescues autoreactive B cells from apoptosis. Given that B cells are tightly involved in the pathogenesis of primary SS, novel prospects for treatment are opened, to such a degree that B-cell ablative therapy has already proven beneficial to the patients. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
