Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has significantly increased in recent years. It is necessary to develop new strategies to combat resistant bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key endogenous molecule that is involved in several biological processes. Activated macrophages synthesize NO, which plays a key role in host defenses against microbes, including pathogenic bacteria. NO has been shown to be an attractive and potent antibiotic against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative resistant bacteria. NO has been shown to prevent and disperse bacterial biofilms. In view of this knowledge, this chapter presents NO as a potent antimicrobial agent by highlighting recent progress in the use of NO donors, NO prodrugs, and NO-releasing nanomaterials against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and biofilms. The multiple mechanisms of NO pathways that prevent bacteria from developing resistance are discussed. We hope to inspire new research in this promising area. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
