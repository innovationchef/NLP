Monozygotic twins are essentially genetic copies. Greater phenotypic concordance between monozygotic twin pairs compared to dizygotic pairs is taken as evidence of an underlying genetic contribution. Discordance between monozygotic twin pairs have been taken as evidence for environmental influences on the phenotype. Twin studies have formed a major foundation for the dissection of complex traits and multifactorial disease in humans. Here, I discuss recent studies using discordant monozygotic twin pairs that suggest a role for epigenetics in simple and complex disorders and in aging. I also highlight caveats in interpretations of the data and some future directions in the field. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
