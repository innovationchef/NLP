Primary Sj├Âgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory infiltrations in exocrine glands. Clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and range from dryness of the eyes and mouth (keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia) to more systemic manifestations such as fatigue. Autoantibodies against Ro/SSA and/or La/SSB are detectable in a majority of the patients. Approximately 90% of patients are females. Cytokines are important mediators of immune responses and tightly regulated in autoimmune diseases, such as pSS; however, this complex system is often dysregulated. Here we present an overview over the most prominent cytokines of the innate immune system found to be involved in pSS. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
