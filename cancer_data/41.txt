Transient expression of exogenous proteins facilitates studies of molecular mechanisms and utility for transplantation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in culture. Here, we compared expression of the membrane protein ╬▓5 integrin- GFP (╬▓5-GFP) in two recently established models of differentiated human RPE, adult RPE stem cell-derived RPE and primary fetal RPE, upon infection with recombinant adenovirus or transfection with DNA in liposomes. We varied viral titer and duration of virus incubation and examined ╬▓5-GFP and the tight junction marker ZO-1 in manipulated cells by confocal microscopy. Fewer than 5 % of cells expressed ╬▓5-GFP after liposome-mediated transfection. The percentage of cells with detectable ╬▓5-GFP exceeded 90 % after adenovirus infection for as little as 1 h. Decreasing virus titer two-fold did not alter the fraction of cells expressing ╬▓5-GFP but increased variability of ╬▓5-GFP level among cells. In cells with low expression levels, ╬▓5-GFP localized mostly to the apical plasma membrane like endogenous ╬▒v╬▓5 integrin. In cells with high expression levels, ╬▓5-GFP localized to the cytoplasm in addition to the apical surface suggesting accumulation in trafficking compartments. Altogether, adenovirus delivery yields efficient exogenous membrane protein expression of correct polarity in differentiated human RPE cells in culture. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
