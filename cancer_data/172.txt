DNA Repair and Cancer Therapy: Molecular Targets and Clinical Applications, Second Edition provides a comprehensive and timely reference that focuses on the translational and clinical use of DNA repair as a target area for the development of diagnostic biomarkers and the enhancement of cancer treatment. Experts on DNA repair proteins from all areas of cancer biology research take readers from bench research to new therapeutic approaches. This book provides a detailed discussion of combination therapies, in other words, how the inhibition of repair pathways can be coupled with chemotherapy, radiation, or DNA damaging drugs. Newer areas in this edition include the role of DNA repair in chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy, radiation DNA damage, Fanconi anemia cross-link repair, translesion DNA polymerases, BRCA1-BRCA2 pathway for HR and synthetic lethality, and mechanisms of resistance to clinical PARP inhibitors. Provides a comprehensive overview of the basic and translational research in DNA repair as a cancer therapeutic target. Includes timely updates from the earlier edition, including Fanconi Anemia cross-link repair, translesion DNA polymerases, chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy, and many other new areas within DNA repair and cancer therapy. Saves academic, medical, and pharma researchers time by allowing them to quickly access the very latest details on DNA repair and cancer therapy. Assists researchers and research clinicians in understanding the importance of the breakthroughs that are contributing to advances in disease-specific research. ┬® 2016, 2012 Elsevier Inc.
