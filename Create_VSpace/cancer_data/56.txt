Interferon gamma, referred to here as IFN- ╬│, is a major component in immunological cell signaling and is a critical regulatory protein for overall immune system function. First discovered in 1965 (Wheelock Science 149: (3681)310ÔÇô311, 1965), IFN- ╬│ is the only Type II interferon identified. Its expression is both positively and negatively controlled by different factors. In this chapter, we will review the transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of IFN-╬│ expression. In the transcriptional control part, the regular activators and suppressors are summarized, we will also focus on the epigenetic control, such as chromosome access, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation. The more we learn about the control of this regulatory protein will allow us to apply this knowledge in the future to effectively manipulate IFN- ╬│ expression for the treatment of infections, cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.
