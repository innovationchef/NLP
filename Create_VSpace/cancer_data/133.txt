Lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, are universally known to contribute to the promotion of good health. However, the first indications of the molecular mechanisms through which these environmental changes impact cellular function have only recently been recognized. Burgeoning studies have proposed the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the molecular responses evoked by environmental changes and their potential to be considered as alternative tools in preventive medicine. Based on the modern concepts of epigenetic vulnerability, increasing evidence has supported the benefits of manipulating nutritional factors and physical exercise in modulating epigenetic patterns for promoting better health. Within this context, the present chapter assesses the current knowledge related to the fundamentals of epigenetic vulnerability to environmental changes and the effects of nutrition and physical exercise on the modulation of epigenetic patterns applied to preventive medicine. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
