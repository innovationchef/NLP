Retinal degeneration (RD) such as retinitis pigmentosa and agerelated macular degeneration are major causes of blindness in adulthood. As one of the model for RD, intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) is widely used because of its selective photoreceptor cell death. It has been reported that MNU increases intracellular calcium ions in the retina and induces photoreceptor cell death. Although calcium ion influx triggers the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activation, the role of nNOS on photoreceptor cell death by MNU has not been reported yet. In this study, we investigated the contribution of nNOS on photoreceptor cell death induced by MNU in mice. MNU significantly increased NOS activation at 3 day after treatment. Then, we evaluated the effect of nNOS specific inhibitor, ethyl[4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] carbamimidothioate (ETPI) on the MNU-induced photoreceptor cell death. At 3 days, ETPI clearly inhibited the MNU-induced cell death in the ONL. These data indicate that nNOS is a key molecule for pathogenesis of MNU-induced photoreceptor cell death. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
