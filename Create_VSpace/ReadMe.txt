Here we create a vector space of term-document matrix.

To run the code simply type python vector_space.py
It will intake 200 .txt files from the cancer_data folder named as 1.txt, 2.txt and so on!

The vectory space created looks like this -- 

     			doc1	doc2	doc3	doc4	....    docN
		term1	5	8	9	0		5	
		term2	2	6	7	3		1
		term3	7	2	4	9		7
		term4	4	2	0	0		6
		.....
		termM	0	7	4	0		9
