The DNA mismatch repair pathway (MMR) is involved in repair of base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops that occur during DNA replication. Over the years, many noncanonical roles have also been established for the MMR pathway, including response to increased oxidative DNA damage, a role in mitotic and meiotic recombination, in chromatin assembly and also in immunoglobulin diversification. Loss of function of mismatch repair genes gives rise to a mutator phenotype and is therefore unsurprisingly, a common feature of a range of different tumor types. In addition, due to a failure in recognition of many drug-induced adducts, MMR deficiency is frequently associated with resistance to many of the commonly used chemotherapies. The focus of this chapter is on mammalian DNA mismatch repair and the implications of its loss in cancer. In particular, we emphasize how exploiting the canonical and noncanonical role of the MMR pathway has elucidated novel ways of treating MMR-deficient cancers. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
