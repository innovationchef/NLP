Social Media (SM) can be a complementary channel of information to other official means for the health data collection such as the epidemiological surveillance activities and control carried out by health authorities. For this reason, more and more organizations, professionals, and scientific institutions are seeing the need to make the most of resources of health information based on SM platforms through the use of Big Data tools and analytics. Although there is a consensus on the potential benefits and opportunities that SM may provide when used for healthcare purposes, its use has brought unsuspected drawbacks and challenges related to the protection of personal data, it is essential to promote a wide reflection and that the authorities and governments establish, in collaboration with patients associations and professional institutions, specific ethical, legal guidelines, and use policies to the benefit of the current and future healthcare professional-patient relationship and general public. ┬® 2016 All rights reserved.
