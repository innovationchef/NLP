Interleukin (IL)-23 plays a central role in the orchestration of inflammatory responses. Produced by dendritic cells and macrophages, this cytokine promotes the protection of the host against mucosal pathogens through the induction of IL-17 and related cytokines by lymphoid cells. Preclinical disease models and association studies in humans have also clearly demonstrated the implication of IL-23 signalling pathway in inflammatory diseases. Indeed, this cytokine is now considered as a major therapeutic target in immune-based pathologies such as psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn's disease. Furthermore, in the context of inflammation-related cancer, IL-23 is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis and progression to metastatic disease. Herein, we review our current understanding of IL-23 regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. We discuss the relevance of these findings in the context of infection, chronic inflammation and cancer. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.
