Mass spectrometry (MS) has become the method of choice for the large-scale analysis of protein ubiquitylation. There exist a number of proposed methods for mapping ubiquitin sites, each with different pros and cons. We present here a protocol for the MS analysis of the ubiquitin-proteome captured by TUBEs and subsequent data analysis. Using dedicated software and algorithms, specifi c information on the presence of ubiquitylated peptides can be obtained from the MS search results. In addition, a quantitative and functional analysis of the ubiquitylated proteins and their interacting partners helps to unravel the biological and molecular processes they are involved in. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.
