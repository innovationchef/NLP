Homologous recombination (HR) is a molecular pathway involved in a multitude of processes, from the generation of genetic diversity to DNA repair and replication. HR provides a mechanism for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks, protecting cells from chromosomal aberrations such as those seen in cancer. During DNA replication, HR proteins promote the stability and recovery of troubled DNA replication forks. This adds robustness, helping the replication machinery avoid underreplication and subsequent chromosome segregation problems. In light of these important genome caretaker functions, it is perhaps not surprising that intrinsic HR deficiencies can promote genome instability and cancer. However, deficits in HR also sensitize tumors to standard-of-care DNA damage treatment and emerging DNA repair inhibitors directed against compensatory repair pathways. Here, we review the links that exist between HR and the development of cancer, and highlight proof-of-principle and clinical studies aimed at targeting HR for anticancer treatment. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
