Nowadays, antibiotic resistance remains a crucial matter in fighting microbial infections. Thus, the screening for novel antimicrobial compounds mainly encompasses the exploration of natural resources, including marine products. Recent data highlighted the impact of marine-derived bacteria, fungi, algae, sponges, and other invertebrates (eg, corals, dinoflagellates, mollusks, gastropods, and tubeworms) for the production of novel antibiotics. Actinomycetes secondary metabolites, cyanobacterial alkaloids and nonribosomal peptides, exopolysaccharides, glycolipids, lipopeptides, bromopyrrole, chloropyrrole, and bromophenyl derivatives are the leading antimicrobial active ingredients from marine bacteria. Marine fungi also biosynthesize antimicrobial compounds, such as cephalosporins, anthraquinones, polyketides, alkaloids, peptides, diterpenoids, steroids, and glicosphingolipids. Fatty acids, bromophenol derivatives, sesquiterpenoid quinones, diterpenoids, and cyclic depsipeptides are antibacterial and antifungal substances isolated from marine algae. Concerning broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds, sponges are characterized by the highest chemical diversity of all marine natural products, in terms of fatty acids, brominated phenols, sesquiterpenoid quinones, diterpenoids, sesterterpenoids, macrolides, sulfated sterols, meroterpenoids, bromopyrrole alkaloids, steroidal alkaloids, lipopeptides, and cyclodepsipeptides. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
