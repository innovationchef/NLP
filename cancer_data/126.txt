In the last decade, strong evidence has emerged on the link between diet and epigenetic mechanisms of diseases. Dietary bioactive molecules from vegetables, fruits, and some beverages have been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory, antioxidative, and anticancer activities through multiple mechanisms including epigenetic changes associated with DNA methylation, histone modifications, and modulation of microRNAs. The epigenetic molecular mechanisms that contribute to the chemopreventive nature of dietary polyphenols have been widely studied, particularly in cancer. In addition, immunosensitization and chemosensitization properties of dietary agents make them viable candidates for combinatorial strategies leading to synergistic beneficial effects. In this chapter, we summarize current knowledge on the most studied natural products, nutrients and food components and their effects on DNA methylation, histone modifications and miRNAs in different diseases. We also provide a review on "epigenetic" clinical trials with dietary phytochemicals on disease susceptibility and their potential as epigenetic chemopreventive agents and epigenetic drugs of the future. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
