Chronic diseases can be referred to the long-term medical conditions which are mostly progressive in nature, i.e., it deteriorates over time. Diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and chronic respiratory problems (e.g., COPD) are not a few examples of chronic diseases and chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability all over the world. Chronic diseases and conditions are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems. Affordable cost, presence mostly in the consumables, and minimal side effects make the naturally occurring compounds interesting and attractive for pharmacological study in recent years. Plants produce diverse types of low molecular weight products mainly for the defense purpose. Among them, the group of secondary metabolites related to a polyphenolic group has been named flavonoids and are of great interest due to their incredible pharmacological properties. In these regard, due to its potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and many important pharmacological properties (relevant to chronic diseases, e.g., urate transporter inhibitor related to gout, modulator of immunosystem related to chronic hypersensitivity, etc.), morin [morin hydrate:2-(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3, 5, 7-trihydroxy-4H-1-benzopy ran-4-one; 3, 5, 7, 20, 40 pentahydroxyflavone], widely found among the Moraceae family, considered as one of the most important key bioflavonols. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of its action on such conditions. In this chapter, we have summarized most of the findings, if not all, available till date. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
