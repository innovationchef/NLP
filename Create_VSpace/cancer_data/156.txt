Pulmonary diseases are one of the leading causes of death in the world. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), lung tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism, as well as other disorders, are significant public health burdens. Although advances in methods of detection, intervention, and treatment have prolonged life for patients, these complex illnesses continue to have serious effects on a large segment of the global population. Epigenetics is defined as the study of heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms that do not alter the nucleotide sequence. There are three main classes of epigenetic marks: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs. DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5 position of cytosine by DNA methyltransferases and can be inherited through cell division. Histone modifications are posttranslational processes such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination of the tails of core histones, each of which plays different roles in gene expression. MicroRNAs are approximately 22 nucleotide-long regulatory RNAs that control gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to mRNA degradation or inhibition of protein translation. Increasingly, the evidence suggests that these three important epigenetic mechanisms play significant roles in the pathogenetic processes of lung diseases. Understanding these mechanisms may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this chapter the influence of epigenetic variations on the pathophysiology of COPD, asthma, interstitial lung diseases, PAH, lung tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism is described. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
