All glaxosmithkline (GSK)-sponsored studies referred to were conducted in accordance with the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with good clinical practices and local regulatory guidelines. All human biological samples were sourced ethically and, where applicable, patient consent was obtained for their use for research. Human in vitro metabolism, using cultured hepatocytes, successfully predicted all of the signifcant metabolites identified in human plasma with the exception of M40, which was characterized as a metabolite formed by dihydroxylation of the alkyl side chain, with unknown stereochemistry, representing approximately 4% of the observed DRM in plasma. Danirixin (GSK1325756), a selective CX chemokine receptor 2 antagonist, shows anti-inflammatory potential for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The human metabolism data obtained in this clinical study significantly contributed to the assessment of the drug interaction risk for danirixin. GW766994, a CCR3 antagonist, was previously under development for the treatment of asthma and rhinitis. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.
