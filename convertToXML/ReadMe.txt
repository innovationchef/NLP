Here we intend to convert pdf files to xml file with xml tag tree--
<processedData>
	<page no="0">
		<heading></heading>
		<body></body>
	</page>
</processedData>

We are doing this because normal pdf2text conversion does not differentiate between subjects.

To run the code use the following in terminal
python pdftoxml.py filename.pdf

To run the pdf2txt.py use the standard documentation available on internet
