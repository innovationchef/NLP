This chapter describes the strategies and tactics that can be used in in vivo studies to help provide the required knowledge and understanding of in vivo metabolism, especially in humans, to provide the best outcomes for candidate drugs as they progress through development and toward clinical use. A final preparation for the human radiolabeled study is to perform a quantitative tissue distribution study which is most often satisfied by performing a quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) study. Where metabolism is thought to be primarily undertaken in the liver, the chimeric humanized mouse model may represent a very useful means of investigating human-specific drug metabolism. Transgenic mice have been developed that are humanized in the liver (or gut) for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa), and pregnane X receptor (PXR), all of which have importance in drug metabolism. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
