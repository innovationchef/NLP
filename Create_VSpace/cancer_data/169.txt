Essential oils (EOs), which are complex blends of biologically active substances, are classified as natural products with pharmacological potential that can be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment and management of human diseases. EOs extracted from medicinal herbs and food plants are gaining a great deal of interest for their multifarious properties. The increased awareness in alternative natural substances is driving the research community to find new avenues for natural pharmacological agents. In this quest, EOs have been highlighted as natural substances having a rich source of compounds with antimicrobial and antibiotic potentiating properties. With the outbreak of antimicrobial resistance worldwide, EOs and their components have proved to provide useful template molecules for the development of alternative antimicrobial drugs. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the methods of extraction of EOs, their proficiency as antimicrobials, their mode of actions, and their efficacy in potentiating conventional antibiotics to counteract the action of resistant pathogens. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
