The human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) mass balance study was aimed at providing a understanding of the Pharmacokinetic (PK)/ADME of sonidegib after administration of a single oral dose of 800mg sonidegib plus tracer amount of 14C radioactivity to six healthy male subjects in an open-label, single-center study. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The study followed the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and local regulations. The metabolite profiling method was designed specifically for the metabolite profiling study, based on findings in preclinical studies and instrumentations available at the contract research organization (CRO) and Novartis Basel. In conclusion, the mass balance and metabolite profiles of sonidegib were successfully characterized in healthy males using a light label approach and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) as the main bioanalytical technique. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
