Epigenetics are DNA modifications that do not involve changes in the sequence of nucleotide bases, but affect the translation of the genetic code to the phenotype. Several epigenetic changes in the DNA are currently being investigated as cancer biomarkers. The aim is to summarize the diagnostic ability of the most promising epigenetic cancer biomarkers in terms of hypermethylated promoter DNA released into the circulation from solid malignant tumors. The diagnostic ability in terms of sensitivity and specificity at disease stages I-IV among patients with lung, gastric, liver, colorectal, and breast cancer is provided. Epigenetic markers have an interesting potential in cancer management and they should be further investigated for early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of the effect of different therapies, as well as monitoring of disease during therapy and follow-up. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
