The success of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods for DNA-damaging carcinogens detection highlights the need to understand the mechanisms by which reactive metabolite (RM) formation can cause toxicity when attempting to undertake hazard and risk assessment. Some of the target organ toxicities caused by RMs are highly reproducible and dose dependent and can readily be reproduced in various preclinical species, as well as in humans. These are referred to as "type A" or intrinsic toxicities. In addition, RMs are an important cause of "type B" or idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IADRs). These affect the liver and/or other target organs. This chapter discusses the methods that available currently for prediction, assessment, and minimization of RM formation, which can be used to undertake risk assessment. Covalent Binding (CVB) has been a valuable tool in the assessment of reactivity of molecules and their metabolites and an important part of RM risk assessment strategies. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
