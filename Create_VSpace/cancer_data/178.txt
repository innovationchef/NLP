In recent years major progress has been made in the understanding of cellular and molecular processes occurring after irradiation for both normal and tumor tissue. On the basis of this information new concepts were developed allowing a specific and efficient targeting of tumors by radiotherapy. In this context the combination of radiotherapy with specific inhibition of signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, or DNA repair are considered to have the greatest potential, because tumors are often deregulated in these processes. To implement these new concepts in the clinics, a broad understanding of the underlying mechanisms is also required allowing to determine reliable biomarkers needed to identify patients which will actually benefit from the new concept. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
