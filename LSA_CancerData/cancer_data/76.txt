Chronic diseases pose a worldwide problem and are only continuing to increase in incidence. Two major factors contributing to the increased incidence in chronic disease are a lack of physical activity and poor diet. As the link between diet and lifestyle and the increased incidence of chronic disease has been well established in the literature, novel preventive, and therapeutic methods should be aimed at naturally derived compounds such as ursolic acid (UA), the focus of this chapter. As chronic diseases, obesity and cancer share the common thread of inflammation and dysregulation of many related pathways, the focus here will be on these two chronic diseases. Significant evidence in the literature supports an important role for natural compounds such as UA in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases like obesity and cancer, and here we have highlighted many of the ways UA has been shown to be a beneficial and versatile phytochemical. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
