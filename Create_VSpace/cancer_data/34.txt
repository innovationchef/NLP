Epigenetic regulation refers to heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve any alteration of the DNA sequence. DNA methylation, histone modifi cation, and gene regulation by microRNAs are well-known epigenetic modulations that are closely associated with several cellular processes and diverse disease states, such as cancers, even under precancerous conditions. More recently, several studies have indicated that epigenetic changes may be associated with renal cystic diseases, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and the restoration of altered epigenetic factors may become a therapeutic target of renal cystic disease and would be expected to have minimal side effects. This review focuses on recently reported fi ndings on epigenetic and considers the potential of targeting epigenetic regulation as a novel therapeutic approach to control cystogenesis. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.
