In last several years, the focus on the origin and progression of human cancers has shifted from genetic to epigenetic regulation, with particular attention to methylation and acetylation events that have profound effect on the eventual expression of oncogenes and the suppression of tumor suppressors. A few drugs targeting these epigenetic changes have already been approved for treatment, albeit not for lung cancer. With the recent advances in the push towards personalized therapy, questions have been asked about the possible targeting of epigenetic events for personalized lung cancer therapy. Some progress has been made but a lot needs to be done. In this chapter, a succinct review of these topics is provided. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
