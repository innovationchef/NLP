DNA-interacting chemotherapy agents such as platinums and bifunctional alkylating agents represent major drugs for the management of advanced cancers, either given alone or in combination with other cytotoxic or targeted agents. The clinical outcome using these agents, however, is unpredictable and often patients experience high rates of recurrence. In particular, development of acquired resistance to these agents represents the hallmark in clinical settings. In many instances resistant cells overcome chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and replication collapse via upregulation of DNA repair and associated cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms; these represent the core of the DNA damage response. Proteins involved in these pathways are regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms and many have protein kinase components modulated by DNA damage-activated mitogen activated kinase (MAPK) cascades. This chapter addresses the role of MAPK signaling in chemotherapy-induced DNA damage response and its relationship to drug resistance, as well as the impact of recently identified mutations in MAPK genes than can either positively or negatively impact on the DNA damage response. The therapeutic potential and limitations of MAPK inhibitors and the necessity of molecular endpoints to identify individuals that can benefit from a therapeutic response which combines cytotoxic chemotherapy with MAPK modulators are discussed. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
