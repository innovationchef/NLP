O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a suicide enzyme that repairs the cytotoxic DNA adducts O6-methylguanine and O6-chloroethylguanine induced by methylating (procarbazine, dacarbazine, streptozotocine, temozolomide) and chloroethylating (lomustine, nimustine, carmustine, fotemustine) anticancer drugs, respectively. MGMT represents an important factor in the resistance of tumors treated with these alkylating agents. Since O6-alkylguanine is not only a toxic DNA lesion but also one that initiates tumorigenesis, MGMT is at the same time a key node in the defense against cancer formation. Here we describe how MGMT protects against the activation of cell death pathways triggered by O6-alkylguanine, the methods employed for detecting MGMT and summarize data concerning the regulation of MGMT, its expression in normal and malignant cells, and its validation as a predictive/prognostic factor in cancer therapy. Furthermore, we discuss strategies for targeting MGMT using MGMT inhibitors in order to improve the efficiency of alkylating agent-based therapy. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
