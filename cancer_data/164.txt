Quantifying landscape connectivity and structural connectivity and relating both to measures of genetic variation is central in landscape genetics. Data from radio-telemetry and genetic analysis provide complementary pictures of the connectivity between populations and can in some cases give opposing results. This chapter focuses on landscape genetic study includes mountain nyala from five localities within the Bale Mountains that comprise about 86% of the total mountain nyala population of the area. In addition one locality in the Arussi Mountains is sampled. The chapter determines the structural connectivity between the different mountain nyala populations across the Bale Mountains by developing habitat-suitability maps using a resource selection function based on generalized linear models. It measures genetic variability and gene flow within and among the main subpopulations of the species and suggested potential corridors that may preserve dispersal of individuals. ┬® 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
