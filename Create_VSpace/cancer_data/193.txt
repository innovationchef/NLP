The advent of biological treatments that target specific biological pathways has led to new perspectives in the management of Sj├Âgren's syndrome (SS). Several molecules involved in SS pathogenesis appear to be potential targets: cytokines and costimulatory/intracellular molecules as well as T cell regulators. Many clinical trials are ongoing and may change in the future the therapeutic approach in SS, among these antiinterleukin (IL)-6, anti-IL-7R, antilymphotoxin ╬▓, anti-CD40, and anti-PI3K ╬┤ are noteworthy. Moreover, mesenchymal stem cell transplantation has been recently proposed as a new and nonconventional treatment for SS in the context of regenerative medicine. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
