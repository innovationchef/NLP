Complex neurodegenerative diseases such as sporadic Alzheimer disease are caused by variable combinations of genetic and environmental risk factors. Epigenetic processes control gene expression at the systems level and allow the cell to maintain homeostasis by transforming relevant stimuli into long-term adaptive changes. The emerging field of neuroepigenetics aims to understand the epigenetic underpinnings of learning and memory processes. Most importantly, deregulation of the epigenome within brain cells has been associated with various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, and the corresponding enzymatic machinery has been suggested as novel drug targets to treat, for example, dementia. In this chapter, we focus on the role of histone acetylation in neurodegenerative diseases and ask the question why these proteins could be suitable therapeutic targets. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
