This chapter includes a practical method of membrane protein production in Leishmania tarentolae cells. We routinely use it to express membrane proteins of the ABC (adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette) family, here exemplified with ABCG6 from L. braziliensis, implicated in phospholipid trafficking and drug efflux. The pLEXSY system used here allows membrane protein production with a mammalian-like N-glycosylation pattern, at high levels and at low costs. Also the effects of an N-terminal truncation of the protein are described. The method is described to allow any kind of membrane protein production. ┬® Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.
