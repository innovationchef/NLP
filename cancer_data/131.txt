Noncoding RNA are implicated in a wide array of human diseases including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, and metabolic. The modulation of noncoding RNA in diseased cells and tissues is considered a highly promising approach for the development of novel therapies. The efforts for the development of novel therapeutics that target noncoding RNA are so far the most advanced for microRNA, although long noncoding RNA are also increasingly recognised as promising therapeutic targets. We present here the various approaches for modulating noncoding RNA and discuss their respective benefits and shortcomings. We also consider candidate noncoding RNA targets for therapeutic manipulation and novel microRNA-based drugs that are currently involved in clinical trials. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
