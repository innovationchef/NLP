Although multiple approaches have emerged for reducing the microbial resistance and morbidity and mortality associated with persistent infections, current statistics reveal their poor efficiency. In this context, recent nanotechnological progress offers a new perspective in infection control, supported by highly specialized and efficient nanomaterials that can control the delivery, release, and efficiency of antimicrobial drugs in particular infections, thus reducing side effects and probably resistance rates. This chapter presents and discusses the current microbial resistance situation, which affects the entire world population and the perspective imposed by magnetite-based nanomaterials in developing alternative therapeutic and preventive antipathogenic approaches. Antimicrobial-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles, polymeric magnetite-based biomaterials, and enzyme-immobilization procedures in magnetic nanosystems with a great impact on antiinfectious therapies are also highlighted. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
