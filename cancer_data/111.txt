Equipment and device qualification and test assay validation in the field of tissue engineered human organs for substance assessment remain formidable tasks with only a few successful examples so far. The hurdles seem to increase with the growing complexity of the biological systems, emulated by the respective models. Controlled single tissue or organ culture in bioreactors improves the organspecific functions and maintains their phenotypic stability for longer periods of time. The reproducibility attained with bioreactor operations is, per se, an advantage for the validation of safety assessment. Regulatory agencies have gradually altered the validation concept from exhaustive ÔÇ£productÔÇØ to rigorous and detailed process characterization, valuing reproducibility as a standard for validation. ÔÇ£Human-on-a-chipÔÇØ technologies applying micro-physiological systems to the in vitro combination of miniaturized human organ equivalents into functional human micro-organisms are nowadays thought to be the most elaborate solution created to date. They target the replacement of the current most complex modelsÔÇölaboratory animals. Therefore, we provide here a road map towards the validation of such ÔÇ£human-on-a-chipÔÇØ models and qualification of their respective bioreactor and microchip equipment along a path currently used for the respective animal models. ┬® Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
