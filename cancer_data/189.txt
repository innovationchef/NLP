Sj├Âgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune, inflammatory condition primarily involving the exocrine glands. Several environmental factors are involved in its pathogenesis, the main role being played by infectious agents. Nonetheless, stress, vaccines, low vitamin D levels, environmental pollution, silicone, and other factors may contribute as triggers in the existence of a predisposing genetic background.The pathogenic pathways leading to an immune response to such substances may cause, under specific circumstances, the disruption of tolerance and the development of autoimmune phenomena. Indeed, the loss of the immune system balance, with B-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and tissue infiltration, has been proposed. Unveiling these factors and pathways will be of great help in understanding and, at best, managing SS. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
