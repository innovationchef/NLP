Complex interactions between genes and the environment drive the development of chronic intestinal diseases. In particular, the microbiota in the intestinal environment appears to significantly impact intestinal heath and susceptibility to disease. New research has begun to examine mechanisms underlying how signals derived from the microbiota are integrated by mammalian cells. Epigenomic mechanisms enable changes in gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. Consistent with this theory of epigenomic regulation, recent work has suggested that epigenomic modifications and the enzymes that maintain DNA and histone modifications integrate local microbial signals to regulate intestinal homeostasis. Here, we will cover links between epigenomics and intestinal development and homeostasis, the microbiota, immune regulation in the intestine, chronic intestinal diseases, and therapeutic approaches. Future studies will continue to move toward a more complete picture of how genetic, diet-derived, and microbial cues are integrated by the epigenome in the development and progression of intestinal disease. ┬® 2016 Elsevier Inc.
